# phindAssist

phindAssist is a simple WebView wrapper for Phind.com

This is a stripped down version of https://github.com/woheller69/gptAssist and https://github.com/woheller69/huggingAssist born out of necessity, given the lack of an official Android app (for now).

It may evolve to be customizable enough to be a small footprint oriented WebView wrapper for any kind of website you may need.
